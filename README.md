# Spotify Clone

As part of my learning journey in front-end web development, I created a basic Spotify clone using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project showcases my skills in building responsive and user-friendly web applications.

## Features

- **Responsive Design:** The application is designed to be fully responsive, providing a seamless experience across different devices.
- **Music Playback:** Users can play, pause, skip, and navigate through songs.
- **Volume Control:** Adjust the volume with a slider.
- **Dynamic Content:** Fetch and display music albums and playlists.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** Structuring the web pages.
- **CSS:** Styling the application with a focus on a clean and modern design.
- **JavaScript:** Implementing interactive features like playback controls and dynamic content loading.
